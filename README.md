# Artatawe

The main purpose of Artatawe is to allow users to auction
artwork to other users. Such a system would normally
run as a web application, but to make this assignment
manageable (at least for the initial version), Artatawe
runs as a stand alone PC application. Only one
user can be logged in at a time. All data will be stored
in files on the local computer.
